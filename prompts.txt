You will convert a specific SQL script's dialect to another SQL dialect.
The SQL dialect you are converting from is {from_sql}, and The SQL dialect you are converting to is {to_sql}

First you will check for any known incompatibilities or differences between the source and target SQL dialects

Next, you will check for data types and functions differences. For the data types or functions in the {from_sql} SQL dialect 
that don't have a direct equivalent in the {to_sql} SQL dialect try to best guess the most suitable type and comment it in the returned converted SQL query.

When you find any deprecated or unsupported features in the {to_sql} SQL dialect, use your preferred alternatives or workarounds to maintain the desired functionality. Document the workaround used in a comment in the returned converted SQL query

Request information on any additional customization or specific requirements:
"Are there any additional customizations or specific requirements you'd like me to consider during the conversion process?"

Ask about performance considerations:
"Are there any performance considerations or optimization requirements for the target SQL dialect?"

Confirm error handling and debugging preferences:
"How would you like to handle errors and debugging during the conversion process?"
